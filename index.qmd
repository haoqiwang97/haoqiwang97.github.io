# About me
I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.utexas.edu/) at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/)<!---, advised by Professor [Mia Markey](https://www.bme.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/markey)-->. My research focuses on building tools to support clinical decision making.

My research interests include:

- Biomedical informatics
- Medical biophysics
- Machine learning
- Clinical decision support

I received my MS degree in Statistics in 2021 at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and BS degree in Physics at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp) in 2019. I did internship at [flywheel.io](https://flywheel.io/) during 2023 summer, where I worked on medical image segmentation. <!---During my undergraduate study, I did research with Professor [Yi Cao](https://biomech.nju.edu.cn/) on single molecule biophysics, including protein-protein interactions, protein unfolding, etc. In summer 2018, I joined Professor [Phillip Messersmith](https://bioinspiredmaterials.berkeley.edu/)'s lab at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), exploring molecular design principles of lysine-DOPA wet adhesion. -->

# Projects

**Medical image segmentation** ([code](https://github.com/haoqiwang97/ct-seg-monai-swin-unetr)), *June. 2023-Aug. 2023*

- Fine-tuned the Swin UNETR (Swin UNEt TRansformers) deep neural network using the BTCV dataset (n=30) for multi-organ CT segmentation on Google Cloud Vertex AI (PyTorch), significantly reducing manual labeling efforts
- Built docker image and deployed model to Flywheel cloud platform, enabling batch inference for large scale analysis
- Conducted comparative analysis of two segmentation algorithms on an independent open-source CT dataset and highlighted the significance of carefully curated acquisition parameters for analyzing specific segmentation outliers

**Text to SQL** ([code](https://github.com/haoqiwang97/PointerSQL_pytorch)), *Mar. 2021-May 2021*

- Built a natural language processing model that translates textual questions to SQL queries
- Implemented recurrent neural network with long short-term memory and attention, beam search, grammar check, and increased the accuracy by more than 20% compared with baseline (PyTorch)

**Texas Crash Counts Time Series Analysis** ([code](https://github.com/haoqiwang97/crash_python)), *Sept. 2021-present*

- Proposed to predict crash count of 5 severity levels in Texas with more than 700,000 observations from 2010 to 2019
- Built deep neural network that merged geometric features, demographic features and time sequence features processed by recurrent neural network, which increased $R^2$ by 15.9% compared with baseline (PyTorch)

**Application of online learning in clinical decision support system** ([code](https://github.com/haoqiwang97/online_learning_fp)), *Oct. 2021-Dec. 2021*

- Proposed to identify a clinical photograph of a prior patient that the current patient perceives as being similar to her mental image of what she will look like post-operatively as fast as possible
- Implemented several bandit algorithms, including Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), tree-based adaptive recommender, graph-based UCB, near neighbor UCB and found near neighbor UCB performs the best with small number of rounds

**Deep reinforcement learning in multi-agent environment** ([code](https://github.com/ChangShiRaine/RL_project_DGN)), *Mar. 2022-May 2022*

- Built deep reinforcement learning model in multi-agent environment of StarCraft II
- Implemented deep graph neural network to model inter-agent interaction, especially added relation kernel (attention mechanism by transformer) for agents to cooperate, which increased reward more than 90% compared with baseline of deep Q learning (PyTorch)
