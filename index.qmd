# About me
I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in [Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.utexas.edu/) at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/)<!---, advised by Professor [Mia Markey](https://www.bme.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/markey)-->. My research focuses on building tools to support clinical decision making.

My research interests include:

- Biomedical informatics
- Medical biophysics
- Machine learning
- Clinical decision support

I received my MS degree in Statistics in 2021 at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and BS degree in Physics at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp) in 2019. I did internship in Scientific Solution Engineering Team at [flywheel.io](https://flywheel.io/) during 2023 summer, where I worked on medical image segmentation and cloud deployment. <!---During my undergraduate study, I did research with Professor [Yi Cao](https://biomech.nju.edu.cn/) on single molecule biophysics, including protein-protein interactions, protein unfolding, etc. In summer 2018, I joined Professor [Phillip Messersmith](https://bioinspiredmaterials.berkeley.edu/)'s lab at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), exploring molecular design principles of lysine-DOPA wet adhesion. -->

# Projects

**Medical Image Segmentation** ([code](https://gitlab.com/flywheel-io/scientific-solutions/gears/ct-seg-monai-swin-unetr/-/tree/GEAR-4503-read-nifti?ref_type=heads)), *June. 2023-Aug. 2023*

- Evaluated 3D image segmentation deep learning models and investigated factors influencing model performance
- Cleaned and processed medical images, including DICOM to NIfTI conversion, image augmentation, etc.
- Fine-tuned neural networks on Google Cloud Vertex AI GPU CUDA with small dataset, reaching accuracy of 0.95
- Managed CI/CD, developed Docker image and deployed models to Kubernetes cloud, enabling large-scale inference
- Built statistical model and demonstrated the importance of acquisition parameters in analyzing outliers

**Text to SQL** ([code](https://github.com/haoqiwang97/PointerSQL_pytorch)), *Mar. 2021-May 2021*

- Led a team to build a natural language processing (NLP) model for translating textual questions into SQL queries
- Implemented RNN-LSTM generative model and attention, beam search, grammar check, which increased the accuracy by 27.2% compared with baseline

**Time Series Counts Models** ([code](https://github.com/haoqiwang97/crash_python)), *Sept. 2021-present*

- Proposed recurrent neural networks to forecast crash counts and trained on 700k records from 2010 to 2019 in Texas 
- Merged geometric, demographic, and temporal features, resulting an increase in R2 by 15.9% compared to baseline 

**Application of online learning in clinical decision support system** ([code](https://github.com/haoqiwang97/online_learning_fp)), *Oct. 2021-Dec. 2021*

- Proposed to identify a clinical photograph of a prior patient that the current patient perceives as being similar to her mental image of what she will look like post-operatively as fast as possible
- Implemented several bandit algorithms, including Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), tree-based adaptive recommender, graph-based UCB, near neighbor UCB and found near neighbor UCB performs the best with small number of rounds

**Deep reinforcement learning in multi-agent environment** ([code](https://github.com/ChangShiRaine/RL_project_DGN)), *Mar. 2022-May 2022*

- Built deep reinforcement learning model in multi-agent environment of StarCraft II
- Implemented deep graph neural network to model inter-agent interaction, especially added relation kernel (attention mechanism by transformer) for agents to cooperate, which increased reward more than 90% compared with baseline of deep Q learning (PyTorch)
